# -Would-You-Rather...-Website
This project is a Would You Rather...? Game Website created as the final project for Fundamentals of Web Design IMM 130
course at The College of New Jersey during the fall 2019 semester. The course mostly focused on web design principles
and HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery. Because of this Formspree was used for the user question subission
as we didn't have enough time in the semester to implement PHP and the login functionality was handled using javascript user local storage
instead of the server saving user data.
